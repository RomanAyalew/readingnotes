## Debugging and Error handling
<!--Notes from Jon Duckett js book!-->
 * Debuging is a process of finding errors. It involves a process of deduction.
 * The console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located .so you can try to find the exact error.
 * javascript has 7 diffrent types of errors. Each creates its own error object,which can tell you its line number and gives a description of the error.
