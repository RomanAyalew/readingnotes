HTML Images Syntax

* The HTML `<img> `tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

* Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The `<img>` tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

* The `<img> `tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

* The ` <img> `tag has two required attributes:

* src - Specifies the path to the image

* alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image

Example,

`<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket">`
