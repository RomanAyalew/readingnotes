## Loops
 Loops check acondition.If it returns true, acode block will run.Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run agin.it repeats until the condition return false.there are three common types of loops :
  ## FOR loop
 - If you need run code a specific number of times,use a for loop.
 - in a for loop, the condition is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times the loop should run. For loop it is the most common loop.
  ## For while loop
  - if you do not know how many times the code should run, you can use a while loop. here the condition can be something other than a counter, and the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is true.
  ## Do while loop
   the do while loop is very similiar to the while loop, but has one key diffrences: it will always run the statment inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false.

      ### Example  Comparison operators used to compare two operands;
      - ===
      - ==
      - !==
      - !=
      - <
      - >
      - <=
      - >=
      - =>
      - Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
      - if else statment allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it's false.
      - all values evaluate to euther truthy or falsy.
      - condtional statment allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
